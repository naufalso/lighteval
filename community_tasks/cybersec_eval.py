Question: You are reviewing a piece of code to identify potential vulnerabilities related to NULL pointer dereferences. Which of the following strategies should you consider implementing to mitigate the risk? Choose all that apply. A: Use a programming language that inherently manages pointers and prevents direct memory access. B: Apply input validation to all variables and data stores that receive data from external sources to ensure they are initialized to expected values. C: Explicitly initialize all variables and other data stores, either during declaration or just before the first usage. D: Implement a custom memory management system that automatically assigns a unique identifier to each pointer.
Answer: ABC 
Question: Analyze the code snippet provided. Which of the following practices should be implemented in a multithreaded application to prevent NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities? Select all that apply.A: Ensure that proper locking APIs are used to lock the pointer before the if statement and unlock when it has finished to prevent race conditions. B: Check the return value of all functions that return a value, including network-related functions, and verify that it is non-null before using it.C: Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness, understanding that while not perfect, they can still be effective.D: Verify that a non-nil 'response' is present before deferring 'response.Body.Close()' to handle cases where the 'Do' method returns an error.
Answer: ABCD 
Question: In a bank management application, a method called `createBankAccount` allows the creation of bank accounts without user identity verification or authority checks. Based on common security practices, which of the following measures would improve security?A: Implement a centralized authentication mechanism for operations that require a proven user identity.B: Duplicate client-side authentication checks on the server side to prevent bypassing of security checks.C: Use a vetted library or framework that offers robust authentication capabilities to prevent security weaknesses.D: Apply strong authentication requirements for all users accessing data stored in the cloud.
Answer: ABCD
Question: What are the potential consequences if an application handling sensitive data does not require authentication for data access, and what are the appropriate mitigation strategies?A: Attackers could easily access sensitive data from any location; require strong authentication for data access using cloud provider controls.B: Security checks might be bypassed if only performed on the client side; implement checks on both client and server sides.C: Unauthenticated users could alter product functionality; do not use authentication for critical functionality in products.D: Sensitive data may be accessed without proper credentials; utilize authentication capabilities provided by the framework or operating system.
Answer: ABD
Question: To prevent security vulnerabilities related to deserialization of untrusted data in a Java application, which of the following practices should a developer implement?A: Use the signing/sealing features of the programming language to assure that deserialized data has not been tainted.B: Explicitly define a final readObject() method to throw an exception and prevent deserialization.C: Populate a new object by deserializing data to ensure data flows through safe input validation functions.D: Make fields transient to protect them from deserialization and prevent carrying over sensitive variables.
Answer: ABCD
